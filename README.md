# Dapper Framework

This is the framework used in [Path to Power](https://github.com/MrEliasen/path-to-power) project, and is made with NodeJS and React + Redux.

This framework contains the user account system, the websocket system and loggers. It is basically the Path To Power project, without the game. Happy hacking!

You can try it out the Path To Power game on the offical website [here](https://pathtopower.online/), if you want to see a use-case for the framework.
